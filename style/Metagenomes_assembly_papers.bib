For both short and long reads (or assembled contigs), alignment is performed using DIAMOND, whereas taxonomic and functional binning, followed by inter- active exploration and analysis, is performed using MEGAN.

  abstract = {The NCBI-nr database is not explicitly designed for the purpose of microbiome analysis, and its increasing size makes its unwieldy and computationally expensive for this purpose. The AnnoTree protein database is only one-quarter the size of the full NCBI-nr database and is explicitly designed for metagenomic analysis, so it should be supported by alignment-based pipelines.           ,              ABSTRACT             In microbiome analysis, one main approach is to align metagenomic sequencing reads against a protein reference database, such as NCBI-nr, and then to perform taxonomic and functional binning based on the alignments. This approach is embodied, for example, in the standard DIAMOND+MEGAN analysis pipeline, which first aligns reads against NCBI-nr using DIAMOND and then performs taxonomic and functional binning using MEGAN. Here, we propose the use of the AnnoTree protein database, rather than NCBI-nr, in such alignment-based analyses to determine the prokaryotic content of metagenomic samples. We demonstrate a 2-fold speedup over the usage of the prokaryotic part of NCBI-nr and increased assignment rates, in particular assigning twice as many reads to KEGG. In addition to binning to the NCBI taxonomy, MEGAN now also bins to the GTDB taxonomy.                            IMPORTANCE               The NCBI-nr database is not explicitly designed for the purpose of microbiome analysis, and its increasing size makes its unwieldy and computationally expensive for this purpose. The AnnoTree protein database is only one-quarter the size of the full NCBI-nr database and is explicitly designed for metagenomic analysis, so it should be supported by alignment-based pipelines.},

  abstract = {Long-read sequencing technologies have substantially improved the assemblies of many isolate bacterial genomes as compared to fragmented short-read assemblies. However, assembling complex metagenomic datasets remains difficult even for state-of-the-art long-read assemblers. Here we present metaFlye, which addresses important long-read metagenomic assembly challenges, such as uneven bacterial composition and intra-species heterogeneity. First, we benchmarked metaFlye using simulated and mock bacterial communities and show that it consistently produces assemblies with better completeness and contiguity than state-of-the-art long-read assemblers. Second, we performed long-read sequencing of the sheep microbiome and applied metaFlye to reconstruct 63 complete or nearly complete bacterial genomes within single contigs. Finally, we show that long-read assembly of human microbiomes enables the discovery of full-length biosynthetic gene clusters that encode biomedically important natural products.},

Our approach, implemented as metaMDBG, combines highly efficient de Bruijn graph assembly in minimizer space, with both a multi-             k             {$\prime$} approach for dealing with variations in genome coverage depth and an abundance-based filtering strategy for simplifying strain complexity. The resulting algorithm is more efficient than the state-of-the-art but with better assembly results. metaMDBG was 1.5 to 12 times faster than competing assemblers and requires between one-tenth and one-thirtieth of the memory across a range of data sets. We obtained up to twice as many high-quality circularised prokaryotic metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) on the most complex communities, and a better recovery of viruses and plasmids. metaMDBG performs particularly well for abundant organisms whilst being robust to the presence of strain diversity. The result is that for the first time it is possible to efficiently reconstruct the majority of complex communities by abundance as nearcomplete MAGs.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Shotgun sequencing of cultured microbial isolates/individual eukaryotes (whole-genome sequencing) and microbial communities (metagenomics) has become commonplace in biology. Very often, sequenced samples encompass organisms spanning multiple domains of life, necessitating increasingly elaborate software for accurate taxonomic classification of assembled sequences.                                         Results               While many software tools for taxonomic classification exist, SprayNPray offers a quick and user-friendly, semi-automated approach, allowing users to separate contigs by taxonomy (and other metrics) of interest. Easy installation, usage, and intuitive output, which is amenable to visual inspection and/or further computational parsing, will reduce barriers for biologists beginning to analyze genomes and metagenomes. This approach can be used for broad-level overviews, preliminary analyses, or as a supplement to other taxonomic classification or binning software. SprayNPray profiles contigs using multiple metrics, including closest homologs from a user-specified reference database, gene density, read coverage, GC content, tetranucleotide frequency, and codon-usage bias.                                         Conclusions               The output from this software is designed to allow users to spot-check metagenome-assembled genomes, identify, and remove contigs from putative contaminants in isolate assemblies, identify bacteria in eukaryotic assemblies (and vice-versa), and identify possible horizontal gene transfer events.},

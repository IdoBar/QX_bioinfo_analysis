  abstract = {Abstract           Linked-read sequencing technologies generate high base quality reads that contain extrapolative information on long-range DNA connectedness. These advantages of linked-read technologies are well known and has been demonstrated in many human genomic and metagenomic studies. However, existing linked-read analysis pipelines (e.g., Long Ranger) were primarily developed to process sequencing data from the human genome and are not suited for analyzing metagenomic sequencing data. Moreover, linked-read analysis pipelines are typically limited to one specific sequencing platform. To address these limitations, we present the Linked-Read ToolKit (LRTK), a unified and versatile toolkit for platform agnostic processing of linked-read sequencing data from both human genomes and metagenomes. LRTK provides functions to perform linked-read simulation, barcode error correction, read cloud assembly, barcode-aware read alignment, reconstruction of long DNA fragments, taxonomic classification and quantification, as well as barcode-assisted genomic variant calling and phasing. LRTK has the ability to process multiple samples automatically, and provides the user with the option to generate reproducible reports during processing of raw sequencing data and at multiple checkpoints throughout downstream analysis. We applied LRTK on two benchmarking and three real linked-read data sets from both the human genome and metagenome. We showcase LRTKs ability to generate comparative performance results from the preceding benchmark study and to report these results in publication-ready HTML document plots. LRTK provides comprehensive and flexible modules along with an easy-to-use Python-based workflow for processing linked-read sequencing datasets, thereby filling the current gap in the field caused by platform-centric genome-specific linked-read data analysis tools.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Human gut microbiota is associated with human health and disease, and is known to have the second-largest genome in the human body. The microbiota genome is important for their functions and metabolites; however, accurate genomic access to the microbiota of the human gut is hindered due to the difficulty of cultivating and the shortcomings of sequencing technology. Therefore, we applied the stLFR library construction method to assemble the microbiota genomes and demonstrated that assembly property outperformed standard metagenome sequencing. Using the assembled genomes as references, SNP, INDEL, and HGT gene analyses were performed. The results demonstrated significant differences in the number of SNPs and INDELs among different individuals. The individual displayed a unique species variation spectrum, and the similarity of strains within individuals decreased over time. In addition, the coverage depth analysis of the stLFR method shows that a sequencing depth of 60X is sufficient for SNP calling. HGT analysis revealed that the genes involved in replication, recombination and repair, mobilome prophages, and transposons were the most transferred genes among different bacterial species in individuals. A preliminary framework for human gut microbiome studies was established using the stLFR library construction method.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Metagenomic evidence of great genetic diversity within the nonconserved regions of the human gut microbial genomes appeals for new methods to elucidate the species-level variability at high resolution. However, current approaches cannot satisfy this methodologically challenge. In this study, we proposed an efficient binning-first-and-assembly-later strategy, named MetaTrass, to recover high-quality species-resolved genomes based on public reference genomes and the single-tube long fragment read (stLFR) technology, which enables cobarcoding. MetaTrass can generate genomes with longer contiguity, higher completeness, and lower contamination than those produced by conventional assembly-first-and-binning-later strategies. From a simulation study on a mock microbial community, MetaTrass showed the potential to improve the contiguity of assembly from kb to Mb without accuracy loss, as compared to other methods based on the next-generation sequencing technology. From four human fecal samples, MetaTrass successfully retrieved 178 high-quality genomes, whereas only 58 ones were provided by the optimal performance of other conventional strategies. Most importantly, these high-quality genomes confirmed the high level of genetic diversity among different samples and unveiled much more. MetaTrass was designed to work with metagenomic reads sequenced by stLFR technology, but is also applicable to other types of cobarcoding libraries. With the high capability of assembling high-quality genomes of metagenomic data sets, MetaTrass seeks to facilitate the study of spatial characters and dynamics of complex microbial communities at enhanced resolution. The open-source code of MetaTrass is available at https://github.com/BGI-Qingdao/MetaTrass.},

  abstract = {Here, we describe single-tube long fragment read (stLFR), a technology that enables sequencing of data from long DNA molecules using economical second-generation sequencing technology. It is based on adding the same barcode sequence to subfragments of the original long DNA molecule (DNA cobarcoding). To achieve this efficiently, stLFR uses the surface of microbeads to create millions of miniaturized barcoding reactions in a single tube. Using a combinatorial process, up to 3.6 billion unique barcode sequences were generated on beads, enabling practically nonredundant cobarcoding with 50 million barcodes per sample. Using stLFR, we demonstrate efficient unique cobarcoding of more than 8 million 20- to 300-kb genomic DNA fragments. Analysis of the human genome NA12878 with stLFR demonstrated high-quality variant calling and phase block lengths up to N50 34 Mb. We also demonstrate detection of complex structural variants and complete diploid de novo assembly of NA12878. These analyses were all performed using single stLFR libraries, and their construction did not significantly add to the time or cost of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) library preparation. stLFR represents an easily automatable solution that enables high-quality sequencing, phasing, SV detection, scaffolding, cost-effective diploid de novo genome assembly, and other long DNA sequencing applications.},

Here we report an algorithm for hybrid assembly, WENGAN, that provides very high quality at low computational cost. We demonstrate de novo assembly of four human genomes using a combination of sequencing data generated on ONT PromethION, PacBio Sequel, Illumina and MGI technology. WENGAN implements efficient algorithms to improve assembly contiguity as well as consensus quality. The resulting genome assemblies have high contiguity (contig NG50: 17.24--80.64\,Mb), few assembly errors (contig NGA50: 11.8--59.59\,Mb), good consensus quality (QV: 27.84--42.88) and high gene completeness (BUSCO complete: 94.6--95.2\%), while consuming low computational resources (CPU hours: 187--1,200). In particular, the               W               ENGAN assembly of the haploid CHM13 sample achieved a contig NG50 of 80.64\,Mb (NGA50: 59.59\,Mb), which surpasses the contiguity of the current human reference genome (GRCh38 contig NG50: 57.88\,Mb).},

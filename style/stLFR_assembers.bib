  abstract = {Abstract                            Generating accurate genome assemblies of large, repeat-rich human genomes has proved difficult using only long, error-prone reads, and most human genomes assembled from long reads add accurate short reads to polish the consensus sequence. Here we report an algorithm for hybrid assembly, WENGAN, that provides very high quality at low computational cost. We demonstrate de novo assembly of four human genomes using a combination of sequencing data generated on ONT PromethION, PacBio Sequel, Illumina and MGI technology. WENGAN implements efficient algorithms to improve assembly contiguity as well as consensus quality. The resulting genome assemblies have high contiguity (contig NG50: 17.24–80.64\,Mb), few assembly errors (contig NGA50: 11.8–59.59\,Mb), good consensus quality (QV: 27.84–42.88) and high gene completeness (BUSCO complete: 94.6–95.2\%), while consuming low computational resources (CPU hours: 187–1,200). In particular, the               W               ENGAN assembly of the haploid CHM13 sample achieved a contig NG50 of 80.64\,Mb (NGA50: 59.59\,Mb), which surpasses the contiguity of the current human reference genome (GRCh38 contig NG50: 57.88\,Mb).},

Although several tools have been developed for each specific SLR technique, a robust standalone scaffolder with high efficiency is warranted for hybrid genome assembly.                                         Results                                In this work, we developed a standalone scaffolding tool, SLR-superscaffolder, to link together contigs in draft assemblies using co-barcoding and paired-end read information. Our top-to-bottom scheme first builds a global scaffold graph based on Jaccard Similarity to determine the order and orientation of contigs, and then locally improves the scaffolds with the aid of paired-end information. We also exploited a screening algorithm to reduce the negative effect of misassembled contigs in the input assembly. We applied SLR-superscaffolder to a human single tube long fragment read sequencing dataset and increased the scaffold NG50 of its corresponding draft assembly 1349 fold. Moreover, benchmarking on different input contigs showed that this approach overall outperformed existing SLR scaffolders, providing longer contiguity and fewer misassemblies, especially for short contigs assembled by next-generation sequencing data. The open-source code of SLR-superscaffolder is available at                 https://github.com/BGI-Qingdao/SLR-superscaffolder                 .                                                        Conclusions               SLR-superscaffolder can dramatically improve the contiguity of a draft assembly by integrating a hybrid assembly strategy.},

However, although some new barcoding protocols are emerging and the range of SLR applications is being expanded, the existing SLR assemblers are optimized for a narrow range of parameters and are not easily extendable to new barcoding technologies and new applications such as metagenomics or hybrid assembly.

However, sequencing costs for third-generation platforms continue to be high. Novel approaches that leverage the low cost of short-read sequencing while capturing long-range information have been developed. In this chapter, we focus on one such approach, the 10x Genomics’ Chromium system. We demonstrate the assembly of the B73 maizeMaize reference genome using the SupernovaSupernova assembler. We also offer suggestions on how one might improve the resulting assembly through analysis of assembly metrics.},

  abstract = {Here, we describe single-tube long fragment read (stLFR), a technology that enables sequencing of data from long DNA molecules using economical second-generation sequencing technology. It is based on adding the same barcode sequence to subfragments of the original long DNA molecule (DNA cobarcoding). To achieve this efficiently, stLFR uses the surface of microbeads to create millions of miniaturized barcoding reactions in a single tube. Using a combinatorial process, up to 3.6 billion unique barcode sequences were generated on beads, enabling practically nonredundant cobarcoding with 50 million barcodes per sample. Using stLFR, we demonstrate efficient unique cobarcoding of more than 8 million 20- to 300-kb genomic DNA fragments. Analysis of the human genome NA12878 with stLFR demonstrated high-quality variant calling and phase block lengths up to N50 34 Mb. We also demonstrate detection of complex structural variants and complete diploid de novo assembly of NA12878. These analyses were all performed using single stLFR libraries, and their construction did not significantly add to the time or cost of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) library preparation. stLFR represents an easily automatable solution that enables high-quality sequencing, phasing, SV detection, scaffolding, cost-effective diploid de novo genome assembly, and other long DNA sequencing applications.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Analyses that use genome assemblies are critically affected by the contiguity, completeness, and accuracy of those assemblies. In recent years single-molecule sequencing techniques generating long-read information have become available and enabled substantial improvement in contig length and genome completeness, especially for large genomes (\&gt;100 Mb), although bioinformatic tools for these applications are still limited.                                         Findings               We developed a software tool to close sequence gaps in genome assemblies, TGS-GapCloser, that uses low-depth (∼10×) long single-molecule reads. The algorithm extracts reads that bridge gap regions between 2 contigs within a scaffold, error corrects only the candidate reads, and assigns the best sequence data to each gap. As a demonstration, we used TGS-GapCloser to improve the scaftig NG50 value of 3 human genome assemblies by 24-fold on average with only ∼10× coverage of Oxford Nanopore or Pacific Biosciences reads, covering with sequence data up to 94.8\% gaps with 97.7\% positive predictive value. These improved assemblies achieve 99.998\% (Q46) single-base accuracy with final inserted sequences having 99.97\% (Q35) accuracy, despite the high raw error rate of single-molecule reads, enabling high-quality downstream analyses, including up to a 31-fold increase in the scaftig NGA50 and up to 13.1\% more complete BUSCO genes. Additionally, we show that even in ultra-large genome assemblies, such as the ginkgo (∼12 Gb), TGS-GapCloser can cover 71.6\% of gaps with sequence data.                                         Conclusions               TGS-GapCloser can close gaps in large genome assemblies using raw long reads quickly and cost-effectively. The final assemblies generated by TGS-GapCloser have improved contiguity and completeness while maintaining high accuracy. The software is available at https://github.com/BGI-Qingdao/TGS-GapCloser.},

  abstract = {Characterizing transcriptomes in non-model organisms has resulted in a massive increase in our understanding of biological phenomena. This boon, largely made possible via high-throughput sequencing, means that studies of functional, evolutionary, and population genomics are now being done by hundreds or even thousands of labs around the world. For many, these studies begin with a de novo transcriptome assembly, which is a technically complicated process involving several discrete steps. The Oyster River Protocol (ORP), described here, implements a standardized and benchmarked set of bioinformatic processes, resulting in an assembly with enhanced qualities over other standard assembly methods. Specifically, ORP produced assemblies have higher Detonate and TransRate scores and mapping rates, which is largely a product of the fact that it leverages a multi-assembler and kmer assembly process, thereby bypassing the shortcomings of any one approach. These improvements are important, as previously unassembled transcripts are included in ORP assemblies, resulting in a significant enhancement of the power of downstream analysis. Further, as part of this study, I show that assembly quality is unrelated with the number of reads generated, above 30 million reads.

  abstract = {Transcriptome assembly using next-generation sequencing data is an important step in a wide range of biological studies at the molecular level. The quality of computationally assembled transcriptomes affects various downstream analyses, such as gene structure prediction, isoform identification, and gene expression analysis. However, the actual accuracy of assembled transcriptomes is usually unknown. Furthermore, assembly quality depends on various factors such as the method used, the parameters (for example, k-mers) used with the method, and the transcript to be assembled. Users often choose an assembly method based solely on availability without considering differences among methods, as well as choices of the parameters. This is partly due to the lack of suitable benchmarking datasets. In this chapter, we provide a review of computational approaches used for transcriptome assembly (genome-guided, de novo, and ensemble), factors that affect assembly performance including those particularly important for plant transcriptomes, and how the transcriptome assembly performance can be assessed. Using examples from plant transcriptomes, we further illustrate how simulated benchmark datasets can be generated and used to compare the quality of transcriptome assemblies and how the performance of transcriptome assemblers can be assessed using various metrics.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Summary: Ability to generate large RNA-Seq datasets created a demand for both de novo and reference-based transcriptome assemblers. However, while many transcriptome assemblers are now available, there is still no unified quality assessment tool for RNA-Seq assemblies. We present rnaQUAST—a tool for evaluating RNA-Seq assembly quality and benchmarking transcriptome assemblers using reference genome and gene database. rnaQUAST calculates various metrics that demonstrate completeness and correctness levels of the assembled transcripts, and outputs them in a user-friendly report.

  abstract = {De novo RNA-Seq assembly facilitates the study of transcriptomes for species without sequenced genomes, but it is challenging to select the most accurate assembly in this context. To address this challenge, we developed a model-based score, RSEM-EVAL, for evaluating assemblies when the ground truth is unknown. We show that RSEM-EVAL correctly reflects assembly accuracy, as measured by REF-EVAL, a refined set of ground-truth-based scores that we also developed. Guided by RSEM-EVAL, we assembled the transcriptome of the regenerating axolotl limb; this assembly compares favorably to a previous assembly. A software package implementing our methods, DETONATE, is freely available at http://deweylab.biostat.wisc.edu/detonate.},

  abstract = {TransRate is a tool for reference-free quality assessment of de novo transcriptome assemblies. Using only the sequenced reads and the assembly as input, we show that multiple common artifacts of de novo transcriptome assembly can be readily detected. These include chimeras, structural errors, incomplete assembly, and base errors. TransRate evaluates these errors to produce a diagnostic quality score for each contig, and these contig scores are integrated to evaluate whole assemblies. Thus, TransRate can be used for de novo assembly filtering and optimization as well as comparison of assemblies generated using different methods from the same input reads. Applying the method to a data set of 155 published de novo transcriptome assemblies, we deconstruct the contribution that assembly method, read length, read quantity, and read quality make to the accuracy of de novo transcriptome assemblies and reveal that variance in the quality of the input data explains 43\% of the variance in the quality of published de novo transcriptome assemblies. Because TransRate is reference-free, it is suitable for assessment of assemblies of all types of RNA, including assemblies of long noncoding RNA, rRNA, mRNA, and mixed RNA samples.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Linked-read sequencing technologies generate high base quality reads that contain extrapolative information on long-range DNA connectedness. These advantages of linked-read technologies are well known and has been demonstrated in many human genomic and metagenomic studies. However, existing linked-read analysis pipelines (e.g., Long Ranger) were primarily developed to process sequencing data from the human genome and are not suited for analyzing metagenomic sequencing data. Moreover, linked-read analysis pipelines are typically limited to one specific sequencing platform. To address these limitations, we present the Linked-Read ToolKit (LRTK), a unified and versatile toolkit for platform agnostic processing of linked-read sequencing data from both human genomes and metagenomes. LRTK provides functions to perform linked-read simulation, barcode error correction, read cloud assembly, barcode-aware read alignment, reconstruction of long DNA fragments, taxonomic classification and quantification, as well as barcode-assisted genomic variant calling and phasing. LRTK has the ability to process multiple samples automatically, and provides the user with the option to generate reproducible reports during processing of raw sequencing data and at multiple checkpoints throughout downstream analysis. We applied LRTK on two benchmarking and three real linked-read data sets from both the human genome and metagenome. We showcase LRTKs ability to generate comparative performance results from the preceding benchmark study and to report these results in publication-ready HTML document plots. LRTK provides comprehensive and flexible modules along with an easy-to-use Python-based workflow for processing linked-read sequencing datasets, thereby filling the current gap in the field caused by platform-centric genome-specific linked-read data analysis tools.},

The microbiota genome is important for their functions and metabolites; however, accurate genomic access to the microbiota of the human gut is hindered due to the difficulty of cultivating and the shortcomings of sequencing technology. Therefore, we applied the stLFR library construction method to assemble the microbiota genomes and demonstrated that assembly property outperformed standard metagenome sequencing. Using the assembled genomes as references, SNP, INDEL, and HGT gene analyses were performed. The results demonstrated significant differences in the number of SNPs and INDELs among different individuals. The individual displayed a unique species variation spectrum, and the similarity of strains within individuals decreased over time. In addition, the coverage depth analysis of the stLFR method shows that a sequencing depth of 60X is sufficient for SNP calling. HGT analysis revealed that the genes involved in replication, recombination and repair, mobilome prophages, and transposons were the most transferred genes among different bacterial species in individuals. A preliminary framework for human gut microbiome studies was established using the stLFR library construction method.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Metagenomic evidence of great genetic diversity within the nonconserved regions of the human gut microbial genomes appeals for new methods to elucidate the species-level variability at high resolution. However, current approaches cannot satisfy this methodologically challenge. In this study, we proposed an efficient binning-first-and-assembly-later strategy, named MetaTrass, to recover high-quality species-resolved genomes based on public reference genomes and the single-tube long fragment read (stLFR) technology, which enables cobarcoding. MetaTrass can generate genomes with longer contiguity, higher completeness, and lower contamination than those produced by conventional assembly-first-and-binning-later strategies. From a simulation study on a mock microbial community, MetaTrass showed the potential to improve the contiguity of assembly from kb to Mb without accuracy loss, as compared to other methods based on the next-generation sequencing technology. From four human fecal samples, MetaTrass successfully retrieved 178 high-quality genomes, whereas only 58 ones were provided by the optimal performance of other conventional strategies. Most importantly, these high-quality genomes confirmed the high level of genetic diversity among different samples and unveiled much more. MetaTrass was designed to work with metagenomic reads sequenced by stLFR technology, but is also applicable to other types of cobarcoding libraries. With the high capability of assembling high-quality genomes of metagenomic data sets, MetaTrass seeks to facilitate the study of spatial characters and dynamics of complex microbial communities at enhanced resolution. The open-source code of MetaTrass is available at https://github.com/BGI-Qingdao/MetaTrass.},

It is based on adding the same barcode sequence to subfragments of the original long DNA molecule (DNA cobarcoding). To achieve this efficiently, stLFR uses the surface of microbeads to create millions of miniaturized barcoding reactions in a single tube. Using a combinatorial process, up to 3.6 billion unique barcode sequences were generated on beads, enabling practically nonredundant cobarcoding with 50 million barcodes per sample. Using stLFR, we demonstrate efficient unique cobarcoding of more than 8 million 20- to 300-kb genomic DNA fragments. Analysis of the human genome NA12878 with stLFR demonstrated high-quality variant calling and phase block lengths up to N50 34 Mb. We also demonstrate detection of complex structural variants and complete diploid de novo assembly of NA12878. These analyses were all performed using single stLFR libraries, and their construction did not significantly add to the time or cost of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) library preparation. stLFR represents an easily automatable solution that enables high-quality sequencing, phasing, SV detection, scaffolding, cost-effective diploid de novo genome assembly, and other long DNA sequencing applications.},

Here we report an algorithm for hybrid assembly, WENGAN, that provides very high quality at low computational cost. We demonstrate de novo assembly of four human genomes using a combination of sequencing data generated on ONT PromethION, PacBio Sequel, Illumina and MGI technology. WENGAN implements efficient algorithms to improve assembly contiguity as well as consensus quality. The resulting genome assemblies have high contiguity (contig NG50: 17.24--80.64\,Mb), few assembly errors (contig NGA50: 11.8--59.59\,Mb), good consensus quality (QV: 27.84--42.88) and high gene completeness (BUSCO complete: 94.6--95.2\%), while consuming low computational resources (CPU hours: 187--1,200).

It identifies reads and contigs aligned locally with high quality on gap flanks or scaffold boundaries of draft assemblies for gap filling and scaffold connection. LOCLA applies to both de novo and reference-based assemblies. It can also utilize reads produced by diverse sequencing techniques, e.g., 10x Genomics (10xG) Linked-Reads, and PacBio HiFi reads.           We validated LOCLA on three human samples and one non-model organism. For the first two human samples, LLD0021C and CHM13, we generated de novo draft assemblies from 10xG Linked-Reads. On LLD0021C, LOCLA improves the draft assembly by adding 23.3 million bases using only 10xG Linked-Reads. These additional bases cover 28,746 protein-coding regions, particularly in pericentromeric and telomeric regions. On the CHM13 sample, we took 10xG Linked-Reads and PacBio HiFi reads as input. As a result, LOCLA added 46.2 million bases to the draft assembly. The increased content enables us to identify genes linked to complex diseases (e.g., ARHGAP11A) and critical biological pathways. We created two reference-guided draft assemblies on the third human sample, HG002, using contigs assembled from PacBio HiFi reads. LOCLA enhances the two draft assemblies by recovering 27.9 million bases (22.26\%) and 35.7 million bases (30.93\%) of the sequences discarded by the reference-guided assembly tool. The results indicate the robustness of LOCLA's contig detection algorithm on gap flanks. Furthermore, we show that 95\% of the sequences filled in by LOCLA have over 80\% accuracy compared with the HG002 reference genome published by the Human Pan-genome Reference Consortium. On the non-model organism, LOCLA enhanced the genome assembly of Bruguiera sexangula (JAHLGP000000000) by decreasing 41.4\% of its gaps and raising the Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) analysis score to 98.10\%.           LOCLA can optimize de novo and reference-guided assemblies using varied sequencing reads. The final assemblies produced by LOCLA have improved in both quantity and quality. The increased gene content may provide a valuable resource in advancing personalized medicine.},

Although several tools have been developed for each specific SLR technique, a robust standalone scaffolder with high efficiency is warranted for hybrid genome assembly.                                         Results                                In this work, we developed a standalone scaffolding tool, SLR-superscaffolder, to link together contigs in draft assemblies using co-barcoding and paired-end read information. Our top-to-bottom scheme first builds a global scaffold graph based on Jaccard Similarity to determine the order and orientation of contigs, and then locally improves the scaffolds with the aid of paired-end information. We also exploited a screening algorithm to reduce the negative effect of misassembled contigs in the input assembly. We applied SLR-superscaffolder to a human single tube long fragment read sequencing dataset and increased the scaffold NG50 of its corresponding draft assembly 1349 fold. Moreover, benchmarking on different input contigs showed that this approach overall outperformed existing SLR scaffolders, providing longer contiguity and fewer misassemblies, especially for short contigs assembled by next-generation sequencing data.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent advances in long-read sequencing technologies enabled accurate and contiguous de novo assemblies of large genomes and metagenomes. However, even long and accurate high-fidelity (HiFi) reads do not resolve repeats that are longer than the read lengths. This limitation negatively affects the contiguity of diploid genome assemblies since two haplomes share many long identical regions. To generate the telomere-to-telomere assemblies of diploid genomes, biologists now construct their HiFi-based phased assemblies and use additional experimental technologies to transform them into more contiguous diploid assemblies. The barcoded linked-reads, generated using an inexpensive TELL-Seq technology, provide an attractive way to bridge unresolved repeats in phased assemblies of diploid genomes. RESULTS: We developed the SpLitteR tool for diploid genome assembly using linked-reads and assembly graphs and benchmarked it against state-of-the-art linked-read scaffolders ARKS and SLR-superscaffolder using human HG002 genome and sheep gut microbiome datasets. The benchmark showed that SpLitteR scaffolding results in 1.5-fold increase in NGA50 compared to the baseline LJA assembly and other scaffolders while introducing no additional misassemblies on the human dataset. CONCLUSION: We developed the SpLitteR tool for assembly graph phasing and scaffolding using barcoded linked-reads. We benchmarked SpLitteR on assembly graphs produced by various long-read assemblers and have demonstrated that TELL-Seq reads facilitate phasing and scaffolding in these graphs. This benchmarking demonstrates that SpLitteR improves upon the state-of-the-art linked-read scaffolders in the accuracy and contiguity metrics. SpLitteR is implemented in C++ as a part of the freely available SPAdes package and is available at https://github.com/ablab/spades/releases/tag/splitter-preprint.},

  abstract = {Abstract             A high-quality genome is the basis for studies on functional, evolutionary, and comparative genomics. The majority of attention has been paid to the solution of complex chromosome structures and highly repetitive sequences, along with the emergence of a new `telomere-to-telomere (T2T) assembly' era. However, the bioinformatic tools for the automatic construction and/or characterization of T2T genome are limited. Here, we developed a user-friendly web toolkit, quarTeT, which currently includes four modules: AssemblyMapper, GapFiller, TeloExplorer, and CentroMiner. First, AssemblyMapper is designed to assemble phased contigs into the chromosome-level genome by referring to a closely related genome. Then, GapFiller would endeavor to fill all unclosed gaps in a given genome with the aid of additional ultra-long sequences. Finally, TeloExplorer and CentroMiner are applied to identify candidate telomere and centromere as well as their localizations on each chromosome. These four modules can be used alone or in combination with each other for T2T genome assembly and characterization. As a case study, by adopting the entire modular functions of quarTeT, we have achieved the Actinidia chinensis genome assembly that is of a quality comparable to the reported genome Hongyang v4.0, which was assembled with the addition of manual handling. Further evaluation of CentroMiner by searching centromeres in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa genomes showed that quarTeT is capable of identifying all the centromeric regions that have been previously detected by experimental methods. Collectively, quarTeT is an efficient toolkit for studies of large-scale T2T genomes and can be accessed at http://www.atcgn.com:8080/quarTeT/home.html without registration.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Long sequencing reads allow increasing contiguity and completeness of fragmented, short-read based genome assemblies by closing assembly gaps, ideally at high accuracy. While several gap closing methods have been developed, these methods often close an assembly gap with sequence that does not accurately represent the true sequence. Here, we developed DENTIST, a sensitive, highly-accurate and automated pipeline method to close gaps in short read assemblies with long reads. DENTIST comprehensively determines repetitive assembly regions to identify reliable and unambiguous alignments of long reads to the right loci, integrates a consensus sequence computation step to obtain a high base accuracy for the inserted sequence, and validates the accuracy of closed gaps. Unlike previous benchmarks, we generated test assemblies that have gaps at the exact positions where real short-read assemblies have gaps. Generating such realistic benchmarks for Drosophila (134 Mb genome), Arabidopsis (119 Mb), hummingbird (1 Gb) and human (3 Gb) and using simulated or real PacBio reads, we show that DENTIST consistently achieves a substantially higher accuracy compared to previous methods, while having a similar sensitivity. As another distinguishing feature, DENTIST can accurately scaffold the given contigs with long reads in addition to closing gaps, extending its application range to contig-only assemblies. In summary, DENTIST provides an accurate approach to improve the contiguity and completeness of fragmented assemblies with long reads. DENTIST9s source code including a Snakemake workflow and Docker container is available at https://github.com/a-ludi/dentist. All test assemblies as a resource for future benchmarking are at https://bds.mpi-cbg.de/hillerlab/DENTIST/.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Assembled draft genomes usually contain many gaps because of the length limit of next-generation sequencing. Although many gap-closing tools have been developed, most of them still attempt to fill gaps on the basis of next-generation sequencing reads (always\,{$<$}\,200\,bp). Hence, the gap-filling effect is inferior. Several tools that use long-reads to close gaps have recently been created. However, they require extensive runtimes, which may not be suitable for large genomes. We describe a gap-closing tool called PGcloser, which supports parallel mode and adopts long-reads/contigs to fill gaps in genome sequences. Three tests show that PGcloser is faster than other tools but exhibits similar accuracy. PGcloser is free open-source software that is available at http://software.tobaccodb.org/software/pgcloser .},

  abstract = {Choosing the optimum assembly approach is essential to achieving a high-quality genome assembly suitable for comparative and evolutionary genomic investigations. Significant recent progress in long-read sequencing technologies such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) has also brought about a large variety of assemblers. Although these have been extensively tested on model species such as Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster, such benchmarking has not been done in Mollusca, which lacks widely adopted model species. Molluscan genomes are notoriously rich in repeats and are often highly heterozygous, making their assembly challenging. Here, we benchmarked 10 assemblers based on ONT raw reads from two published molluscan genomes of differing properties, the gastropod Chrysomallon squamiferum (356.6 Mb, 1.59\% heterozygosity) and the bivalve Mytilus coruscus (1593 Mb, 1.94\% heterozygosity). By optimizing the assembly pipeline, we greatly improved both genomes from previously published versions. Our results suggested that 40-50X of ONT reads are sufficient for high-quality genomes, with Flye being the recommended assembler for compact and less heterozygous genomes exemplified by C. squamiferum, while NextDenovo excelled for more repetitive and heterozygous molluscan genomes exemplified by M. coruscus. A phylogenomic analysis using the two updated genomes with 32 other published high-quality lophotrochozoan genomes resulted in maximum support across all nodes, and we show that improved genome quality also leads to more complete matrices for phylogenomic inferences. Our benchmarking will ensure efficiency in future assemblies for molluscs and perhaps also for other marine phyla with few genomes available.

  abstract = {Completing a genome is an important goal of genome assembly. However, many assemblies, including reference assemblies, are unfinished and have a number of gaps. Long reads obtained from third-generation sequencing (TGS) platforms can help close these gaps and improve assembly contiguity. However, current gap-closure approaches using long reads require extensive runtime and high memory usage. Thus, a fast and memory-efficient approach using long reads is needed to obtain complete genomes.We developed LR\_Gapcloser to rapidly and efficiently close the gaps in genome assembly. This tool utilizes long reads generated from TGS sequencing platforms. Tested on de novo assembled gaps, repeat-derived gaps, and real gaps, LR\_Gapcloser closed a higher number of gaps faster and with a lower error rate and a much lower memory usage than two existing, state-of-the art tools. This tool utilized raw reads to fill more gaps than when using error-corrected reads. It is applicable to gaps in the assemblies by different approaches and from large and complex genomes. After performing gap-closure using this tool, the contig N50 size of the human CHM1 genome was improved from 143~kb to 19~Mb, a 132-fold increase. We also closed the gaps in the Triticum urartu genome, a large genome rich in repeats; the contig N50 size was increased by 40\%. Further, we evaluated the contiguity and correctness of six hybrid assembly strategies by combining the optimal TGS-based and next-generation sequencing-based assemblers with LR\_Gapcloser. A proposed and optimal hybrid strategy generated a new human CHM1 genome assembly with marked contiguity. The contig N50 value was greater than 28~Mb, which is larger than previous non-reference assemblies of the diploid human genome.LR\_Gapcloser is a fast and efficient tool that can be used to close gaps and improve the contiguity of genome assemblies. A proposed hybrid assembly including this tool promises reference-grade assemblies. The software is available at http://www.fishbrowser.org/software/LR\_Gapcloser/.},

Despite the rapid advancements in sequencing technologies, the inherent complexities of genomes inevitably lead to gaps during genome assembly. To obviate this, numerous genome gap-filling tools utilizing long reads have emerged. However, a comprehensive evaluation of these tools is currently lacking. In this study, we evaluated seven software under various ploidy levels and different data generation methods, and assessing them using QUAST and two additional criteria such as accuracy and completeness. Our findings revealed that the performance of the different tools varied across diverse ploidy levels. Based on accuracy and completeness, FGAP emerged as the top-performing tool, excelling in both haploid and tetraploid scenarios. This evaluation of commonly used genome gap-filling tools aims to provide users with valuable insights for tool selection, assisting them in choosing the most suitable genome gap-filling tool for their specific needs.},

  abstract = {Third-generation sequencing technologies can generate very long reads with relatively high error rates. The lengths of the reads, which sometimes exceed one million bases, make them invaluable for resolving complex repeats that cannot be assembled using shorter reads. Many high-quality genome assemblies have already been produced, curated, and annotated using the previous generation of sequencing data, and full re-assembly of these genomes with long reads is not always practical or cost-effective. One strategy to upgrade existing assemblies is to generate additional coverage using long-read data, and add that to the previously assembled contigs. SAMBA is a tool that is designed to scaffold and gap-fill existing genome assemblies with additional long-read data, resulting in substantially greater contiguity. SAMBA is the only tool of its kind that also computes and fills in the sequence for all spanned gaps in the scaffolds, yielding much longer contigs. Here we compare SAMBA to several similar tools capable of re-scaffolding assemblies using long-read data, and we show that SAMBA yields better contiguity and introduces fewer errors than competing methods. SAMBA is open-source software that is distributed at https://github.com/alekseyzimin/masurca.},

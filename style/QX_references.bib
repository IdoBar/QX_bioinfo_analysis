Despite recent breakthroughs in long-read sequencing, high quality genomic data are very limited in O. denselamellosa. Here, we carried out the first whole genome sequencing at the chromosome-level in O. denselamellosa. Our studies yielded a 636~Mb assembly with scaffold N50 around 71.80~Mb. 608.3~Mb (95.6\% of the assembly) were anchored to 10 chromosomes. A total of 26,412 protein-coding genes were predicted, of which 22,636 (85.7\%) were functionally annotated. By comparative genomics, we found that long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) and short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) made up a larger proportion in O. denselamellosa genome than in other oysters'. Moreover, gene family analysis showed some initial insight into its evolution. This high-quality genome of O. denselamellosa provides a valuable genomic resource for studies of evolution, adaption and conservation in oysters.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oysters have important ecological functions in their natural environment, acting as global carbon sinks and improving water quality by removing excess nutrients from the water column. During their life-time oysters are exposed to a variety of pathogens that can cause severe mortality in a range of oyster species. Environmental stressors encountered in their habitat can increase the susceptibility of oysters to these pathogens and in general have been shown to impact on oyster immunity, making immune parameters expressed in these marine animals an important research topic. RESULTS: Paired-end Illumina high throughput sequencing of six S. glomerata tissues exposed to different environmental stressors resulted in a total of 484,121,702 paired-end reads. When reads and assembled transcripts were compared to the C. gigas genome, an overall low level of similarity at the nucleotide level, but a relatively high similarity at the protein level was observed. Examination of the tissue expression pattern showed that some transcripts coding for cathepsins, heat shock proteins and antioxidant proteins were exclusively expressed in the haemolymph of S. glomerata, suggesting a role in innate immunity. Furthermore, analysis of the S. glomerata ORFs showed a wide range of genes potentially involved in innate immunity, from pattern recognition receptors, components of the Toll-like signalling and apoptosis pathways to a complex antioxidant defence mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large scale RNA-Seq study carried out in S. glomerata, showing the complex network of innate immune components that exist in this species. The results confirmed that many of the innate immune system components observed in mammals are also conserved in oysters; however, some, such as the TLR adaptors MAL, TRIF and TRAM are either missing or have been modified significantly. The components identified in this study could help explain the oysters' natural resilience against pathogenic microorganisms encountered in their natural environment.},

Here, we report a high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly of O. edulis, generated using PacBio HiFi-CCS long reads and annotated with Nanopore full-length transcriptome. The O. edulis genome covers 946.06~Mb (scaffold N50 94.82~Mb) containing 34,495 protein-coding genes and a high proportion of repeat sequences (58.49~\%). The reconstructed demographic histories show that O. edulis population might be shaped by breeding habit (embryo brooding) and historical climatic change. Comparative genomic analysis indicates that transposable elements may drive lineage-specific evolution in oysters. Notably, the O. edulis genome has a Hox gene cluster rearrangement that has never been reported in bivalves, making this species valuable for evolutionary studies of molluscan diversification. Moreover, genome expansion of O. edulis is probably central to its adaptation to filter-feeding and sessile lifestyles, as well as embryo brooding and pathogen resistance, in coastal ecosystems. This chromosome-level genome assembly provides new insights into the genome feature of oysters, and presents an important resource for genetic research, evolutionary studies, and biological conservation of O. edulis.},

Several species, such as the Pacific oyster (Magallana gigas), the American oyster (Crassostrea virginica), the European oyster (Ostrea edulis) and the Sydney rock oyster (Saccostrea glomerata), are currently farmed at a large scale. However a number of other species may also be suitable for commercial-scale aquaculture. One such species is the 'black-lip oyster', a large Saccostrea species of uncertain taxonomic affinity found in northern Australia. Here, phylogenetic analysis of the COI gene places this oyster within a clade identified in a previous study of Japanese Saccostrea species, 'Saccostrea lineage J'. To facilitate comparisons between this oyster and the better-studied S. glomerata, de novo transcriptomes were generated from larval stages and adult tissues of both species. Patterns of orthology indicated an expansion of repetitive elements within Saccostrea genomes when compared to M. gigas and C. virginica, which may be reflected in increased evolutionary rates and/or genome sizes. The generation of high-quality transcriptomes for these two commercially relevant oysters provides a valuable resource for gene identification and comparison of molecular processes in these and other mollusc species.},

While extensive genomic tools are available for C. gigas, highly contiguous reference genomes are required to support both fundamental and applied research. Herein we report the creation and annotation of a chromosome-level assembly for C. gigas.High-coverage long- and short-read sequence data generated on Pacific Biosciences and Illumina platforms were used to generate an initial assembly, which was then scaffolded into 10 pseudo-chromosomes using both Hi-C sequencing and a high-density linkage map. The assembly has a scaffold N50 of 58.4 Mb and a contig N50 of 1.8 Mb, representing a step advance on the previously published C. gigas assembly. Annotation based on Pacific Biosciences Iso-Seq and Illumina RNA-Seq resulted in identification of {$\sim$}30,000~putative protein-coding genes. Annotation of putative repeat elements highlighted an enrichment of Helitron rolling-circle transposable elements, suggesting their potential role in shaping the evolution of the C. gigas genome.This new chromosome-level assembly will be an enabling resource for genetics and genomics studies to support fundamental insight into bivalve biology, as well as for selective breeding of C. gigas in aquaculture.}

Contending with disease and environmental stress are considerable challenges to oyster culture. Here we report a draft genome of the Sydney Rock Oyster, Saccostrea glomerata, an iconic and commercially important species of edible oyster in Australia known for its enhanced resilience to harsh environmental conditions. This is the second reference genome to be reported from the family Ostreidae enabling a genus-level study of lophotrochozoan genome evolution. Our analysis of the 784-megabase S. glomerata genome shows extensive expansions of gene families associated with immunological non-self-recognition. Transcriptomic analysis revealed highly tissue-specific patterns of expression among these genes, suggesting a complex assortment of immune receptors provide this oyster with a unique capacity to recognize invading microbes. Several gene families involved in stress response are notably expanded in Saccostrea compared with other oysters, and likely key to this species' adaptations for improved survival higher in the intertidal zone. The Sydney Rock Oyster genome provides a valuable resource for future research in molluscan biology, evolution and environmental resilience. Its close relatedness to Crassostrea will further comparative studies, advancing the means for improved oyster agriculture and conservation.},

  abstract = {Choosing the optimum assembly approach is essential to achieving a high-quality genome assembly suitable for comparative and evolutionary genomic investigations. Significant recent progress in long-read sequencing technologies such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) has also brought about a large variety of assemblers. Although these have been extensively tested on model species such as               Homo sapiens               and               Drosophila melanogaster               , such benchmarking has not been done in Mollusca, which lacks widely adopted model species. Molluscan genomes are notoriously rich in repeats and are often highly heterozygous, making their assembly challenging. Here, we benchmarked 10 assemblers based on ONT raw reads from two published molluscan genomes of differing properties, the gastropod               Chrysomallon squamiferum               (356.6 Mb, 1.59\% heterozygosity) and the bivalve               Mytilus coruscus               (1593 Mb, 1.94\% heterozygosity). By optimizing the assembly pipeline, we greatly improved both genomes from previously published versions. Our results suggested that 40--50X of ONT reads are sufficient for high-quality genomes, with Flye being the recommended assembler for compact and less heterozygous genomes exemplified by               C. squamiferum               , while NextDenovo excelled for more repetitive and heterozygous molluscan genomes exemplified by               M. coruscus               . A phylogenomic analysis using the two updated genomes with 32 other published high-quality lophotrochozoan genomes resulted in maximum support across all nodes, and we show that improved genome quality also leads to more complete matrices for phylogenomic inferences. Our benchmarking will ensure efficiency in future assemblies for molluscs and perhaps also for other marine phyla with few genomes available.

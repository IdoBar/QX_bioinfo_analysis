Despite recent breakthroughs in long-read sequencing, high quality genomic data are very limited in O. denselamellosa. Here, we carried out the first whole genome sequencing at the chromosome-level in O. denselamellosa. Our studies yielded a 636~Mb assembly with scaffold N50 around 71.80~Mb. 608.3~Mb (95.6\% of the assembly) were anchored to 10 chromosomes. A total of 26,412 protein-coding genes were predicted, of which 22,636 (85.7\%) were functionally annotated. By comparative genomics, we found that long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) and short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) made up a larger proportion in O. denselamellosa genome than in other oysters'. Moreover, gene family analysis showed some initial insight into its evolution. This high-quality genome of O. denselamellosa provides a valuable genomic resource for studies of evolution, adaption and conservation in oysters.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oysters have important ecological functions in their natural environment, acting as global carbon sinks and improving water quality by removing excess nutrients from the water column. During their life-time oysters are exposed to a variety of pathogens that can cause severe mortality in a range of oyster species. Environmental stressors encountered in their habitat can increase the susceptibility of oysters to these pathogens and in general have been shown to impact on oyster immunity, making immune parameters expressed in these marine animals an important research topic. RESULTS: Paired-end Illumina high throughput sequencing of six S. glomerata tissues exposed to different environmental stressors resulted in a total of 484,121,702 paired-end reads. When reads and assembled transcripts were compared to the C. gigas genome, an overall low level of similarity at the nucleotide level, but a relatively high similarity at the protein level was observed. Examination of the tissue expression pattern showed that some transcripts coding for cathepsins, heat shock proteins and antioxidant proteins were exclusively expressed in the haemolymph of S. glomerata, suggesting a role in innate immunity. Furthermore, analysis of the S. glomerata ORFs showed a wide range of genes potentially involved in innate immunity, from pattern recognition receptors, components of the Toll-like signalling and apoptosis pathways to a complex antioxidant defence mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large scale RNA-Seq study carried out in S. glomerata, showing the complex network of innate immune components that exist in this species. The results confirmed that many of the innate immune system components observed in mammals are also conserved in oysters; however, some, such as the TLR adaptors MAL, TRIF and TRAM are either missing or have been modified significantly. The components identified in this study could help explain the oysters' natural resilience against pathogenic microorganisms encountered in their natural environment.},

Here, we report a high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly of O. edulis, generated using PacBio HiFi-CCS long reads and annotated with Nanopore full-length transcriptome. The O. edulis genome covers 946.06~Mb (scaffold N50 94.82~Mb) containing 34,495 protein-coding genes and a high proportion of repeat sequences (58.49~\%). The reconstructed demographic histories show that O. edulis population might be shaped by breeding habit (embryo brooding) and historical climatic change. Comparative genomic analysis indicates that transposable elements may drive lineage-specific evolution in oysters. Notably, the O. edulis genome has a Hox gene cluster rearrangement that has never been reported in bivalves, making this species valuable for evolutionary studies of molluscan diversification. Moreover, genome expansion of O. edulis is probably central to its adaptation to filter-feeding and sessile lifestyles, as well as embryo brooding and pathogen resistance, in coastal ecosystems. This chromosome-level genome assembly provides new insights into the genome feature of oysters, and presents an important resource for genetic research, evolutionary studies, and biological conservation of O. edulis.},

Several species, such as the Pacific oyster (Magallana gigas), the American oyster (Crassostrea virginica), the European oyster (Ostrea edulis) and the Sydney rock oyster (Saccostrea glomerata), are currently farmed at a large scale. However a number of other species may also be suitable for commercial-scale aquaculture. One such species is the 'black-lip oyster', a large Saccostrea species of uncertain taxonomic affinity found in northern Australia. Here, phylogenetic analysis of the COI gene places this oyster within a clade identified in a previous study of Japanese Saccostrea species, 'Saccostrea lineage J'. To facilitate comparisons between this oyster and the better-studied S. glomerata, de novo transcriptomes were generated from larval stages and adult tissues of both species. Patterns of orthology indicated an expansion of repetitive elements within Saccostrea genomes when compared to M. gigas and C. virginica, which may be reflected in increased evolutionary rates and/or genome sizes. The generation of high-quality transcriptomes for these two commercially relevant oysters provides a valuable resource for gene identification and comparison of molecular processes in these and other mollusc species.},

Herein we report the creation and annotation of a chromosome-level assembly for C. gigas.High-coverage long- and short-read sequence data generated on Pacific Biosciences and Illumina platforms were used to generate an initial assembly, which was then scaffolded into 10 pseudo-chromosomes using both Hi-C sequencing and a high-density linkage map. The assembly has a scaffold N50 of 58.4 Mb and a contig N50 of 1.8 Mb, representing a step advance on the previously published C. gigas assembly. Annotation based on Pacific Biosciences Iso-Seq and Illumina RNA-Seq resulted in identification of {$\sim$}30,000~putative protein-coding genes. Annotation of putative repeat elements highlighted an enrichment of Helitron rolling-circle transposable elements, suggesting their potential role in shaping the evolution of the C. gigas genome.This new chromosome-level assembly will be an enabling resource for genetics and genomics studies to support fundamental insight into bivalve biology, as well as for selective breeding of C. gigas in aquaculture.}

Contending with disease and environmental stress are considerable challenges to oyster culture. Here we report a draft genome of the Sydney Rock Oyster, Saccostrea glomerata, an iconic and commercially important species of edible oyster in Australia known for its enhanced resilience to harsh environmental conditions. This is the second reference genome to be reported from the family Ostreidae enabling a genus-level study of lophotrochozoan genome evolution. Our analysis of the 784-megabase S. glomerata genome shows extensive expansions of gene families associated with immunological non-self-recognition. Transcriptomic analysis revealed highly tissue-specific patterns of expression among these genes, suggesting a complex assortment of immune receptors provide this oyster with a unique capacity to recognize invading microbes. Several gene families involved in stress response are notably expanded in Saccostrea compared with other oysters, and likely key to this species' adaptations for improved survival higher in the intertidal zone. The Sydney Rock Oyster genome provides a valuable resource for future research in molluscan biology, evolution and environmental resilience. Its close relatedness to Crassostrea will further comparative studies, advancing the means for improved oyster agriculture and conservation.},

  abstract = {Choosing the optimum assembly approach is essential to achieving a high-quality genome assembly suitable for comparative and evolutionary genomic investigations. Significant recent progress in long-read sequencing technologies such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) has also brought about a large variety of assemblers. Although these have been extensively tested on model species such as               Homo sapiens               and               Drosophila melanogaster               , such benchmarking has not been done in Mollusca, which lacks widely adopted model species. Molluscan genomes are notoriously rich in repeats and are often highly heterozygous, making their assembly challenging. Here, we benchmarked 10 assemblers based on ONT raw reads from two published molluscan genomes of differing properties, the gastropod               Chrysomallon squamiferum               (356.6 Mb, 1.59\% heterozygosity) and the bivalve               Mytilus coruscus               (1593 Mb, 1.94\% heterozygosity). By optimizing the assembly pipeline, we greatly improved both genomes from previously published versions. Our results suggested that 40--50X of ONT reads are sufficient for high-quality genomes, with Flye being the recommended assembler for compact and less heterozygous genomes exemplified by               C. squamiferum               , while NextDenovo excelled for more repetitive and heterozygous molluscan genomes exemplified by               M. coruscus               . A phylogenomic analysis using the two updated genomes with 32 other published high-quality lophotrochozoan genomes resulted in maximum support across all nodes, and we show that improved genome quality also leads to more complete matrices for phylogenomic inferences. Our benchmarking will ensure efficiency in future assemblies for molluscs and perhaps also for other marine phyla with few genomes available.

  abstract = {Abstract           Linked-read sequencing technologies generate high base quality reads that contain extrapolative information on long-range DNA connectedness. These advantages of linked-read technologies are well known and has been demonstrated in many human genomic and metagenomic studies. However, existing linked-read analysis pipelines (e.g., Long Ranger) were primarily developed to process sequencing data from the human genome and are not suited for analyzing metagenomic sequencing data. Moreover, linked-read analysis pipelines are typically limited to one specific sequencing platform. To address these limitations, we present the Linked-Read ToolKit (LRTK), a unified and versatile toolkit for platform agnostic processing of linked-read sequencing data from both human genomes and metagenomes. LRTK provides functions to perform linked-read simulation, barcode error correction, read cloud assembly, barcode-aware read alignment, reconstruction of long DNA fragments, taxonomic classification and quantification, as well as barcode-assisted genomic variant calling and phasing. LRTK has the ability to process multiple samples automatically, and provides the user with the option to generate reproducible reports during processing of raw sequencing data and at multiple checkpoints throughout downstream analysis. We applied LRTK on two benchmarking and three real linked-read data sets from both the human genome and metagenome. We showcase LRTK’s ability to generate comparative performance results from the preceding benchmark study and to report these results in publication-ready HTML document plots. LRTK provides comprehensive and flexible modules along with an easy-to-use Python-based workflow for processing linked-read sequencing datasets, thereby filling the current gap in the field caused by platform-centric genome-specific linked-read data analysis tools.},

  abstract = {Transcriptome assembly using next-generation sequencing data is an important step in a wide range of biological studies at the molecular level. The quality of computationally assembled transcriptomes affects various downstream analyses, such as gene structure prediction, isoform identification, and gene expression analysis. However, the actual accuracy of assembled transcriptomes is usually unknown. Furthermore, assembly quality depends on various factors such as the method used, the parameters (for example, k-mers) used with the method, and the transcript to be assembled. Users often choose an assembly method based solely on availability without considering differences among methods, as well as choices of the parameters. This is partly due to the lack of suitable benchmarking datasets. In this chapter, we provide a review of computational approaches used for transcriptome assembly (genome-guided, de novo, and ensemble), factors that affect assembly performance including those particularly important for plant transcriptomes, and how the transcriptome assembly performance can be assessed. Using examples from plant transcriptomes, we further illustrate how simulated benchmark datasets can be generated and used to compare the quality of transcriptome assemblies and how the performance of transcriptome assemblers can be assessed using various metrics.},

  abstract = {TransRate is a tool for reference-free quality assessment of de novo transcriptome assemblies. Using only the sequenced reads and the assembly as input, we show that multiple common artifacts of de novo transcriptome assembly can be readily detected. These include chimeras, structural errors, incomplete assembly, and base errors. TransRate evaluates these errors to produce a diagnostic quality score for each contig, and these contig scores are integrated to evaluate whole assemblies. Thus, TransRate can be used for de novo assembly filtering and optimization as well as comparison of assemblies generated using different methods from the same input reads. Applying the method to a data set of 155 published de novo transcriptome assemblies, we deconstruct the contribution that assembly method, read length, read quantity, and read quality make to the accuracy of de novo transcriptome assemblies and reveal that variance in the quality of the input data explains 43\% of the variance in the quality of published de novo transcriptome assemblies. Because TransRate is reference-free, it is suitable for assessment of assemblies of all types of RNA, including assemblies of long noncoding RNA, rRNA, mRNA, and mixed RNA samples.},

Here we report an algorithm for hybrid assembly, WENGAN, that provides very high quality at low computational cost. We demonstrate de novo assembly of four human genomes using a combination of sequencing data generated on ONT PromethION, PacBio Sequel, Illumina and MGI technology. WENGAN implements efficient algorithms to improve assembly contiguity as well as consensus quality. The resulting genome assemblies have high contiguity (contig NG50: 17.24–80.64\,Mb), few assembly errors (contig NGA50: 11.8–59.59\,Mb), good consensus quality (QV: 27.84–42.88) and high gene completeness (BUSCO complete: 94.6–95.2\%), while consuming low computational resources (CPU hours: 187–1,200).

Although several tools have been developed for each specific SLR technique, a robust standalone scaffolder with high efficiency is warranted for hybrid genome assembly.                                         Results                                In this work, we developed a standalone scaffolding tool, SLR-superscaffolder, to link together contigs in draft assemblies using co-barcoding and paired-end read information. Our top-to-bottom scheme first builds a global scaffold graph based on Jaccard Similarity to determine the order and orientation of contigs, and then locally improves the scaffolds with the aid of paired-end information. We also exploited a screening algorithm to reduce the negative effect of misassembled contigs in the input assembly. We applied SLR-superscaffolder to a human single tube long fragment read sequencing dataset and increased the scaffold NG50 of its corresponding draft assembly 1349 fold. Moreover, benchmarking on different input contigs showed that this approach overall outperformed existing SLR scaffolders, providing longer contiguity and fewer misassemblies, especially for short contigs assembled by next-generation sequencing data. The open-source code of SLR-superscaffolder is available at                 https://github.com/BGI-Qingdao/SLR-superscaffolder                 .

It is based on adding the same barcode sequence to subfragments of the original long DNA molecule (DNA cobarcoding). To achieve this efficiently, stLFR uses the surface of microbeads to create millions of miniaturized barcoding reactions in a single tube. Using a combinatorial process, up to 3.6 billion unique barcode sequences were generated on beads, enabling practically nonredundant cobarcoding with 50 million barcodes per sample. Using stLFR, we demonstrate efficient unique cobarcoding of more than 8 million 20- to 300-kb genomic DNA fragments. Analysis of the human genome NA12878 with stLFR demonstrated high-quality variant calling and phase block lengths up to N50 34 Mb. We also demonstrate detection of complex structural variants and complete diploid de novo assembly of NA12878. These analyses were all performed using single stLFR libraries, and their construction did not significantly add to the time or cost of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) library preparation. stLFR represents an easily automatable solution that enables high-quality sequencing, phasing, SV detection, scaffolding, cost-effective diploid de novo genome assembly, and other long DNA sequencing applications.},

In recent years single-molecule sequencing techniques generating long-read information have become available and enabled substantial improvement in contig length and genome completeness, especially for large genomes (\&gt;100 Mb), although bioinformatic tools for these applications are still limited.                                         Findings               We developed a software tool to close sequence gaps in genome assemblies, TGS-GapCloser, that uses low-depth (∼10×) long single-molecule reads. The algorithm extracts reads that bridge gap regions between 2 contigs within a scaffold, error corrects only the candidate reads, and assigns the best sequence data to each gap. As a demonstration, we used TGS-GapCloser to improve the scaftig NG50 value of 3 human genome assemblies by 24-fold on average with only ∼10× coverage of Oxford Nanopore or Pacific Biosciences reads, covering with sequence data up to 94.8\% gaps with 97.7\% positive predictive value. These improved assemblies achieve 99.998\% (Q46) single-base accuracy with final inserted sequences having 99.97\% (Q35) accuracy, despite the high raw error rate of single-molecule reads, enabling high-quality downstream analyses, including up to a 31-fold increase in the scaftig NGA50 and up to 13.1\% more complete BUSCO genes. Additionally, we show that even in ultra-large genome assemblies, such as the ginkgo (∼12 Gb), TGS-GapCloser can cover 71.6\% of gaps with sequence data.                                         Conclusions               TGS-GapCloser can close gaps in large genome assemblies using raw long reads quickly and cost-effectively. The final assemblies generated by TGS-GapCloser have improved contiguity and completeness while maintaining high accuracy.

An analysis of laboratory metadata revealed a strong effect of the sequencing center: nearly all the detected events of between-species contamination involved species that were sent the same day to the same company. We introduce new methods to address the amount of within-species, between-individual contamination, and to correct for this problem when calling genotypes from base read counts. Conclusions We report evidence for pervasive within-species contamination in this data set, and show that classical population genomic statistics, such as synonymous diversity, the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous diversity, inbreeding coefficient FIT, and Tajima’s D, are sensitive to this problem to various extents. Control analyses suggest that our published results are probably robust to the problem of contamination. Recommendations on how to prevent or avoid contamination in large-scale population genomics/molecular ecology are provided based on this analysis.

One consequence of such sequencing data explosion is the increasing cost and complexity of data processing. The preprocessing of FASTQ data, which means removing adapter contamination, filtering low-quality reads, and correcting wrongly represented bases, is an indispensable but resource intensive part of sequencing data analysis. Therefore, although a lot of software applications have been developed to solve this problem, bioinformatics scientists and engineers are still pursuing faster, simpler, and more energy-efficient software. Several years ago, the author developed fastp, which is an ultrafast all-in-one FASTQ data preprocessor with many modern features. This software has been approved by many bioinformatics users and has been continuously maintained and updated. Since the first publication on fastp, it has been greatly improved, making it even faster and more powerful. For instance, the duplication evaluation module has been improved, and a new deduplication module has been added. This study aimed to introduce the new features of fastp and demonstrate how it was designed and implemented.},

Results: We developed the RSeQC package to comprehensively evaluate different aspects of RNA-seq experiments, such as sequence quality, GC bias, PCR bias, nucleotide composition bias, sequencing depth, strand specificity, coverage uniformity, and read distribution over the genome structure. RSeQC takes both SAM and BAM files as input, which can be produced by most RNA-seq mapping tools, as well as BED files, which are widely used for gene models. Most modules in RSeQC take advantage of R scripts for visualization, and they are notably efficient in dealing with large BAM/SAM files containing hundreds of millions of alignments.

The resulting algorithm is more efficient than the state-of-the-art but with better assembly results. metaMDBG was 1.5 to 12 times faster than competing assemblers and requires between one-tenth and one-thirtieth of the memory across a range of data sets. We obtained up to twice as many high-quality circularised prokaryotic metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) on the most complex communities, and a better recovery of viruses and plasmids. metaMDBG performs particularly well for abundant organisms whilst being robust to the presence of strain diversity. The result is that for the first time it is possible to efficiently reconstruct the majority of complex communities by abundance as nearcomplete MAGs.},

Here we show that deep sequencing using long (HiFi) reads combined with Hi-C binning can address this challenge even for complex microbial communities. Using existing methods, we sequenced the sheep fecal metagenome and identified 428 MAGs with more than 90\% completeness, including 44 MAGs in single circular contigs. To resolve closely related strains (lineages), we developed MAGPhase, which separates lineages of related organisms by discriminating variant haplotypes across hundreds of kilobases of genomic sequence. MAGPhase identified 220 lineage-resolved MAGs in our dataset. The ability to resolve closely related microbes in complex microbial communities improves the identification of biosynthetic gene clusters and the precision of assigning mobile genetic elements to host genomes. We identified 1,400 complete and 350 partial biosynthetic gene clusters, most of which are novel, as well as 424 (298) potential host–viral (host–plasmid) associations using Hi-C data.},

Metagenomic assemblies built using long read nanopore data depend on the read level accuracy. The read level accuracy of nanopore sequencing has made dramatic improvements over the past several years. However, we do not know if the increased read level accuracy allows for faster assemblers to make as accurate metagenomic assemblies as slower assemblers. Here, we present the results of a benchmarking study comparing three commonly used long read assemblers, Flye, Raven, and Redbean. We used a prepared DNA standard of seven bacteria as our input community. We prepared a sequencing library using a VolTRAX V2 and sequenced using a MinION mk1b. We basecalled with Guppy v5.0.7 using the super-accuracy model. We found that increasing read depth benefited each of the assemblers, and nearly complete community member chromosomes were assembled with as little as 10× read depth. Polishing assemblies using Medaka had a predictable improvement in quality. We found Flye to be the most robust across taxa and was the most effective assembler for recovering plasmids. Based on Flye’s consistency for chromosomes and increased effectiveness at assembling plasmids, we would recommend using Flye in future metagenomic studies.},

However, heterogeneity in the metagenome hinders assembly and introduces interspecies misassembly deleterious for downstream analysis. For this purpose, we developed a hybrid metagenome assembler, MetaPlatanus. First, as a characteristic function, it assembles the basic contigs from accurate short reads and then iteratively utilizes long-range sequence links, species-specific sequence compositions, and coverage depth. The binning information was also used to improve contiguity. Benchmarking using mock datasets consisting of known bacteria with long reads or mate pairs revealed the high contiguity MetaPlatanus with a few interspecies misassemblies. For published human gut data with nanopore reads from potable sequencers, MetaPlatanus assembled many biologically important elements, such as coding genes, gene clusters, viral sequences, and over-half bacterial genomes. In the benchmark with published human saliva data with high-throughput nanopore reads, the superiority of MetaPlatanus was considerably more evident. We found that some high-abundance bacterial genomes were assembled only by MetaPlatanus as near-complete. Furthermore, MetaPlatanus can circumvent the limitations of highly fragmented assemblies and frequent interspecies misassembles obtained by the other tools. Overall, the study demonstrates that MetaPlatanus could be an effective approach for exploring large-scale structures in metagenomes.},

Second, we performed long-read sequencing of the sheep microbiome and applied metaFlye to reconstruct 63 complete or nearly complete bacterial genomes within single contigs. Finally, we show that long-read assembly of human microbiomes enables the discovery of full-length biosynthetic gene clusters that encode biomedically important natural products.},

Closing gaps in draft genomes have been approaching with the inclusion of Nanopore long reads; however, genome quality improvement requires extensive and time-consuming high-accuracy short-read polishing.                                         Results               Here, we introduce NanoPhase, an open-source tool to reconstruct reference-quality genomes from complex metagenomes using only Nanopore long reads. Using Kit 9 and Q20+ chemistries, we first evaluated the feasibility of NanoPhase using a ZymoBIOMICS gut microbiome standard (including 21 strains), then sequenced the complex activated sludge microbiome and reconstructed 275 MAGs with median completeness of \textasciitilde{} 90\%. As a result, NanoPhase improved the MAG contiguity (median MAG N50: 735 Kb, 44-86X compared to conventional short-read-based methods) while maintaining high accuracy, allowing for a full and accurate investigation of target microbiomes. Additionally, leveraging these high-contiguity reference-quality genomes, we identified 165 prophages within 111 MAGs, with 5 as active prophages, indicating the prophage was a neglected source of genetic diversity within microbial populations and influencer in shaping microbial composition in the activated sludge microbiome.                                         Conclusions               Our results demonstrated that NanoPhase enables reference-quality genome reconstruction from complex metagenomes directly using only Nanopore long reads. Furthermore, besides the 16S rRNA genes and biosynthetic gene clusters, the generated high-accuracy and high-contiguity MAGs improved the host identification of critical mobile genetic elements, e.g., prophage, serving as a genomic blueprint to investigate the microbial potential and ecology in the activated sludge ecosystem.},

However, metagenomic assembly, especially when only short reads are available, is a complex and challenging task because mixed genomes of multiple microorganisms constitute the metagenome. Although long read sequencing technologies have been developed and have begun to be used for metagenomic assembly, many metagenomic studies have been performed based on short reads because the generation of long reads requires higher sequencing cost than short reads.                                         Results               In this study, we present a new method called PLR-GEN. It creates pseudo–long reads from metagenomic short reads based on given reference genome sequences by considering small sequence variations existing in individual genomes of the same or different species. When applied to a mock community data set in the Human Microbiome Project, PLR-GEN dramatically extended short reads in length of 101~bp to pseudo–long reads with N50 of 33~Kbp and 0.4\% error rate. The use of these pseudo–long reads generated by PLR-GEN resulted in an obvious improvement of metagenomic assembly in terms of the number of sequences, assembly contiguity, and prediction of species and genes.

  abstract = {PacBio long reads sequencing presents several potential advantages for DNA assembly, including being able to provide more complete gene profiling of metagenomic samples. However, lower single-pass accuracy can make gene discovery and assembly for low-abundance organisms difficult. To evaluate the application and performance of PacBio long reads and Illumina HiSeq short reads in metagenomic analyses, we directly compared various assemblies involving PacBio and Illumina sequencing reads based on two anaerobic digestion microbiome samples from a biogas fermenter. Using a PacBio platform, 1.58 million long reads (19.6 Gb) were produced with an average length of 7,604 bp. Using an Illumina HiSeq platform, 151.2 million read pairs (45.4 Gb) were produced. Hybrid assemblies using PacBio long reads and HiSeq contigs produced improvements in assembly statistics, including an increase in the average contig length, contig N50 size, and number of large contigs. Interestingly, depth-based hybrid assemblies generated a higher percentage of complete genes (98.86\%) compared to those based on HiSeq contigs only (40.29\%), because the PacBio reads were long enough to cover many repeating short elements and capture multiple genes in a single read. Additionally, the incorporation of PacBio long reads led to considerable advantages regarding reducing contig numbers and increasing the completeness of the genome reconstruction, which was poorly assembled and binned when using HiSeq data alone. From this comparison of PacBio long reads with Illumina HiSeq short reads related to complex microbiome samples, we conclude that PacBio long reads can produce longer contigs, more complete genes, and better genome binning, thereby offering more information about metagenomic samples.},

  abstract = {Background De novo transcriptome assembly of short reads is now a common step in expression analysis of organisms lacking a reference genome sequence. Several software packages are available to perform this task. Even if their results are of good quality it is still possible to improve them in several ways including redundancy reduction or error correction. Trinity and Oases are two commonly used de novo transcriptome assemblers. The contig sets they produce are of good quality. Still, their compaction (number of contigs needed to represent the transcriptome) and their quality (chimera and nucleotide error rates) can be improved. Results We built a de novo RNA-Seq Assembly Pipeline (DRAP) which wraps these two assemblers (Trinity and Oases) in order to improve their results regarding the above-mentioned criteria. DRAP reduces from 1.3 to 15 fold the number of resulting contigs of the assemblies depending on the read set and the assembler used. This article presents seven assembly comparisons showing in some cases drastic improvements when using DRAP. DRAP does not significantly impair assembly quality metrics such are read realignment rate or protein reconstruction counts. Conclusion Transcriptome assembly is a challenging computational task even if good solutions are already available to end-users, these solutions can still be improved while conserving the overall representation and quality of the assembly. The de novo RNA-Seq Assembly Pipeline (DRAP) is an easy to use software package to produce compact and corrected transcript set.

These will include (1) strategic decisions that have to be made in advance, regarding sequencing technology and reference to use; (2) how to search for available draft genomes, and, if necessary, how to improve their gene prediction and annotation; (3) how to clean raw reads before de novo assembly; (4) how to separate the reads in RNA-Seq projects of symbiont organisms; (5) how to design and carry out a de novo transcriptome assembly that will be comprehensive and reliable; (6) how to assess transcriptome quality; (7) when and how to reduce redundancy in the transcriptome; (8) techniques and considerations in transcriptome functional annotation; (9) quantitating transcript abundance in the face of high transcriptome redundancy; and, most importantly, (10) how to achieve functional enrichment testing using available tools which either support a large range of species or enable a universal, non-species-specific analysis.Throughout the chapter, we will refer to a variety of useful software tools. For the initial analysis steps involving high-volume data, these will include Linux-based programs. For the later steps, we will describe both Linux and R packages for advanced users, as well as many user-friendly tools for nonprogrammers.

However, it relies on two implicit assumptions: that the assembled transcriptome is an unbiased representation of the underlying expressed transcriptome, and that expression estimates from the assembly are good, if noisy approximations of the relative abundance of expressed transcripts. Using publicly available data for model organisms, we demonstrate that, across assembly algorithms and data sets, these assumptions are consistently violated. Bias exists at the nucleotide level, with genotyping error rates ranging from 30\% to 83\%. As a result, diversity is underestimated in transcriptome assemblies, with consistent underestimation of heterozygosity in all but the most inbred samples. Even at the gene level, expression estimates show wide deviations from map-to-reference estimates, and positive bias at lower expression levels. Standard filtering of transcriptome assemblies improves the robustness of gene expression estimates but leads to the loss of a meaningful number of protein-coding genes, including many that are highly expressed. We demonstrate a computational method, length-rescaled CPM, to partly alleviate noise and bias in expression estimates. Researchers should consider ways to minimize the impact of bias in transcriptome assemblies.},

  abstract = {A decade ago, de novo transcriptome assembly evolved as a versatile and powerful approach to make evolutionary assumptions, analyse gene expression, and annotate novel transcripts, in particular, for non-model organisms lacking an appropriate reference genome. Various tools have been developed to generate a transcriptome assembly, and even more computational methods depend on the results of these tools for further downstream analyses. In this issue of Molecular Ecology Resources, Freedman et al. (Mol Ecol Resourc 2020) present a comprehensive analysis of errors in de novo transcriptome assemblies across public data sets and different assembly methods. They focus on two implicit assumptions that are often violated: First, the assembly presents an unbiased view of the transcriptome. Second, the expression estimates derived from the assembly are reasonable, albeit noisy, approximations of the relative frequency of expressed transcripts. They show that appropriate filtering can reduce this bias but can also lead to the loss of a reasonable number of highly expressed transcripts. Thus, to partly alleviate the noise in expression estimates, they propose a new normalization method called length-rescaled CPM. Remarkably, the authors found considerable distortions at the nucleotide level, which leads to an underestimation of diversity in transcriptome assemblies. The study by Freedman et al. (Mol Ecol Resourc 2020) clearly shows that we have not yet reached "high-quality" in the field of transcriptome assembly. Above all, it helps researchers be aware of these problems and filter and interpret their transcriptome assembly data appropriately and with caution.},

In particular, for non-model organisms and in the absence of an appropriate reference genome, RNA-Seq is used to reconstruct the transcriptome de~novo. Although the de~novo transcriptome assembly of non-model organisms has been on the rise recently and new tools are frequently developing, there is still a knowledge gap about which assembly software should be used to build a comprehensive de~novo assembly. RESULTS: Here, we present a large-scale comparative study in which 10 de~novo assembly tools are applied to 9 RNA-Seq data sets spanning different kingdoms of life. Overall, we built {$>$}200 single assemblies and evaluated their performance on a combination of 20 biological-based and reference-free metrics. Our study is accompanied by a comprehensive and extensible Electronic Supplement that summarizes all data sets, assembly execution instructions, and evaluation results. Trinity, SPAdes, and Trans-ABySS, followed by Bridger and SOAPdenovo-Trans, generally outperformed the other tools compared. Moreover, we observed species-specific differences in the performance of each assembler. No tool delivered the best results for all data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend a careful choice and normalization of evaluation metrics to select the best assembling results as a critical step in the reconstruction of a comprehensive de~novo transcriptome assembly.},

In total, 550,871 transcripts were assembled, corresponding to 422,999 putative genes. Of those, we identified 23,500, 37,349, 38,120 and 45,885 genes present in the Pfam, EggNOG, KEGG and GO databases, respectively. Interestingly, our results suggested that genes related to immune system and defense mechanisms are abundant in the transcriptome of O. cruralis. We also present a pipeline to assist with pre-processing, assembling, evaluating and functionally annotating a de-novo transcriptome from RNA-seq data of non-model organisms. Our pipeline guides the inexperienced user in an intuitive way through all the necessary steps to build de-novo transcriptome assemblies using readily available software and is freely available at: https://github.com/biomendi/TRANSCRIPTOME-ASSEMBLY-PIPELINE/wiki.},

  abstract = {A transcriptome constructed from short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is an easily attainable proxy catalog of protein-coding genes when genome assembly is unnecessary, expensive or difficult. In the absence of a sequenced genome to guide the reconstruction process, the transcriptome must be assembled de novo using only the information available in the RNA-seq reads. Subsequently, the sequences must be annotated in order to identify sequence-intrinsic and evolutionary features in them (for example, protein-coding regions). Although straightforward at first glance, de novo transcriptome assembly and annotation can quickly prove to be challenging undertakings. In addition to familiarizing themselves with the conceptual and technical intricacies of the tasks at hand and the numerous pre- and post-processing steps involved, those interested must also grapple with an overwhelmingly large choice of tools. The lack of standardized workflows, fast pace of development of new tools and techniques and paucity of authoritative literature have served to exacerbate the difficulty of the task even further. Here, we present a comprehensive overview of de novo transcriptome assembly and annotation. We discuss the procedures involved, including pre- and post-processing steps, and present a compendium of corresponding tools.}

When an organism has a well-characterized and annotated genome, reads obtained from RNA-Seq experiments can be directly mapped to that genome to estimate the number of transcripts present and relative expression levels of these transcripts. However, for unknown genomes, de novo assembly of RNA-Seq reads must be performed to generate a set of contigs that represents the transcriptome. These contig sets contain multiple transcripts, including immature mRNAs, spliced transcripts and allele variants, as well as products of close paralogs or gene families that can be difficult to distinguish. Thus, tools are needed to select a set of less redundant contigs to represent the transcriptome for downstream analyses. Here we describe the development of Compacta to produce contig sets from de novo assemblies.},

  abstract = {The use of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data and the generation of de novo transcriptome assemblies have been pivotal for studies in ecology and evolution. This is especially true for nonmodel organisms, where no genome information is available. In such organisms, studies of differential gene expression, DNA enrichment bait design and phylogenetics can all be accomplished with de novo transcriptome assemblies. Multiple tools are available for transcriptome assembly, but no single tool can provide the best assembly for all data sets. Therefore, a multi-assembler approach, followed by a reduction step, is often sought to generate an improved representation of the assembly. To reduce errors in these complex analyses while at the same time attaining reproducibility and scalability, automated workflows have been essential in the analysis of RNA-Seq data. However, most of these tools are designed for species where genome data are used as reference for the assembly process, limiting their use in nonmodel organisms. We present TransPi, a comprehensive pipeline for de novo transcriptome assembly, with minimum user input but without losing the ability of a thorough analysis. A combination of different model organisms, k-mer sets, read lengths and read quantities was used for assessing the tool. Furthermore, a total of 49 nonmodel organisms, spanning different phyla, were also analysed. Compared to approaches using single assemblers only, TransPi produces higher BUSCO completeness percentages, and a concurrent significant reduction in duplication rates. TransPi is easy to configure and can be deployed seamlessly using Conda, Docker and Singularity.},

  abstract = {TransRate is a tool for reference-free quality assessment of de novo transcriptome assemblies. Using only the sequenced reads and the assembly as input, we show that multiple common artifacts of de novo transcriptome assembly can be readily detected. These include chimeras, structural errors, incomplete assembly, and base errors. TransRate evaluates these errors to produce a diagnostic quality score for each contig, and these contig scores are integrated to evaluate whole assemblies. Thus, TransRate can be used for de novo assembly filtering and optimization as well as comparison of assemblies generated using different methods from the same input reads. Applying the method to a data set of 155 published de novo transcriptome assemblies, we deconstruct the contribution that assembly method, read length, read quantity, and read quality make to the accuracy of de novo transcriptome assemblies and reveal that variance in the quality of the input data explains 43\% of the variance in the quality of published de novo transcriptome assemblies. Because TransRate is reference-free, it is suitable for assessment of assemblies of all types of RNA, including assemblies of long noncoding RNA, rRNA, mRNA, and mixed RNA samples.},

  abstract = {Analyses of high-throughput transcriptome sequences of non-model organisms are based on two main approaches: de novo assembly and genome-guided assembly using mapping to assign reads prior to assembly. Given the limits of mapping reads to a reference when it is highly divergent, as is frequently the case for non-model species, we evaluate whether using blastn would outperform mapping methods for read assignment in such situations ({$>$}15\% divergence). We demonstrate its high performance by using simulated reads of lengths corresponding to those generated by the most common sequencing platforms, and over a realistic range of genetic divergence (0\% to 30\% divergence). Here we focus on gene identification and not on resolving the whole set of transcripts (i.e. the complete transcriptome). For simulated datasets, the transcriptome-guided assembly based on blastn recovers 94.8\% of genes irrespective of read length at 0\% divergence; however, assignment rate of reads is negatively correlated with both increasing divergence level and reducing read lengths. Nevertheless, we still observe 92.6\% of recovered genes at 30\% divergence irrespective of read length. This analysis also produces a categorization of genes relative to their assignment, and suggests guidelines for data processing prior to analyses of comparative transcriptomics and gene expression to minimize potential inferential bias associated with incorrect transcript assignment. We also compare the performances of de novo assembly alone vs in combination with a transcriptome-guided assembly based on blastn both via simulation and empirically, using data from a cyprinid fish species and from an oak species. For any simulated scenario, the transcriptome-guided assembly using blastn outperforms the de novo approach alone, including when the divergence level is beyond the reach of traditional mapping methods. Combining de novo assembly and a related reference transcriptome for read assignment also addresses the bias/error in contigs caused by the dependence on a related reference alone. Empirical data corroborate these findings when assembling transcriptomes from the two non-model organisms: Parachondrostoma toxostoma (fish) and Quercus pubescens (plant). For the fish species, out of the 31,944 genes known from D. rerio, the guided and de novo assemblies recover respectively 20,605 and 20,032 genes but the performance of the guided assembly approach is much higher for both the contiguity and completeness metrics. For the oak, out of the 29,971 genes known from Vitis vinifera, the transcriptome-guided and de novo assemblies display similar performance, but the new guided approach detects 16,326 genes where the de novo assembly only detects 9,385 genes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systems-level analyses, such as differential gene expression analysis, co-expression analysis, and metabolic pathway reconstruction, depend on the accuracy of the transcriptome. Multiple tools exist to perform transcriptome assembly from RNAseq data. However, assembling high quality transcriptomes is still not a trivial problem. This is especially the case for non-model organisms where adequate reference genomes are often not available. Different methods produce different transcriptome models and there is no easy way to determine which are more accurate. Furthermore, having alternative-splicing events exacerbates such difficult assembly problems. While benchmarking transcriptome assemblies is critical, this is also not trivial due to the general lack of true reference transcriptomes. RESULTS: In this study, we first provide a pipeline to generate a set of the simulated~benchmark transcriptome and corresponding RNAseq data. Using the simulated benchmarking datasets, we compared the performance of various transcriptome assembly approaches including both de novo and genome-guided methods. The results showed that the assembly performance deteriorates significantly when alternative transcripts (isoforms) exist or for genome-guided methods when the reference is not available from the same genome. To improve the transcriptome assembly performance, leveraging the overlapping predictions between different assemblies, we present a new consensus-based ensemble transcriptome assembly approach, ConSemble. CONCLUSIONS: Without using a reference genome, ConSemble using four de novo assemblers achieved an accuracy up to twice as high as any de novo assemblers we compared. When a reference genome is available, ConSemble using four genome-guided assemblies removed many incorrectly assembled contigs with minimal impact on correctly assembled contigs, achieving higher precision and accuracy than individual genome-guided methods. Furthermore, ConSemble using de novo assemblers matched or exceeded the best performing genome-guided assemblers even when the transcriptomes included isoforms. We thus demonstrated that the ConSemble consensus strategy both for de novo and genome-guided assemblers can improve transcriptome assembly. The RNAseq simulation pipeline, the benchmark transcriptome datasets, and the script to perform the ConSemble assembly are all freely available from: http://bioinfolab.unl.edu/emlab/consemble/ .},

However, the development of a new technology, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), now promises to allow the analysis of both partners simultaneously.This dual RNA-seq approach is not without difficulties, owing to the very different nature of bacterial and eukaryotic cells, and especially the properties of the RNAs in these two different domains of life.There are various technical considerations required for the successful determination of the host and pathogen transcriptomes. An analysis of these considerations has led to the proposal that the dual RNA-seq approach is currently becoming feasible and will probably become the gold standard for host–pathogen transcriptomics in the future.},

  abstract = {The transcriptome is a powerful proxy for the physiological state of a cell, healthy or diseased. As a result, transcriptome analysis has become a key tool in understanding the molecular changes that accompany bacterial infections of eukaryotic cells. Until recently, such transcriptomic studies have been technically limited to analyzing mRNA expression changes in either the bacterial pathogen or the infected eukaryotic host cell. However, the increasing sensitivity of high-throughput RNA sequencing now enables “dual RNA-seq” studies, simultaneously capturing all classes of coding and noncoding transcripts in both the pathogen and the host. In the five years since the concept of dual RNA-seq was introduced, the technique has been applied to a range of infection models. This has not only led to a better understanding of the physiological changes in pathogen and host during the course of an infection but has also revealed hidden molecular phenotypes of virulence-associated small noncoding RNAs that were not visible in standard infection assays. Here, we use the knowledge gained from these recent studies to suggest experimental and computational guidelines for the design of future dual RNA-seq studies. We conclude this review by discussing prospective applications of the technique.},

The documentation and management of these changes requires accurate estimates of species diversity. Recently, there has been an increased recognition of the abundance and importance of cryptic species, i.e. those that are morphologically identical but genetically distinct. This article presents the largest genetic investigation into the prevalence of cryptic polychaete species within the deep Antarctic benthos to date. We uncover cryptic diversity in 50\% of the 15 morphospecies targeted through the comparison of mitochondrial DNA sequences, as well as 10 previously overlooked morphospecies, increasing the total species richness in the sample by 233\%. Our ability to describe universal rules for the detection of cryptic species within polychaetes, or normalization to expected number of species based on genetic data is prevented by taxon-specific differences in phylogenetic outputs and genetic variation between and within potential cryptic species. These data provide the foundation for biogeographic and functional analysis that will provide insight into the drivers of species diversity and its role in ecosystem function.},

Factors explaining this decline include over-exploitation of natural populations and diseases like bonamiosis, regulated across both the EU and the wider world and caused by the intracellular protozoan parasite Bonamia ostreae. To date, very limited sequence data are available for this Haplosporidian species. We present here the first transcriptome of B. ostreae. As this protozoan is not yet culturable, it remains extremely challenging to obtain high-quality -omic data. Thanks to a specific parasite isolation protocol and a dedicated bioinformatic pipeline, we were able to obtain a high-quality transcriptome for an intracellular marine micro-eukaryote, which will be very helpful to better understand its biology and to consider the development of new relevant diagnostic tools.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oysters have important ecological functions in their natural environment, acting as global carbon sinks and improving water quality by removing excess nutrients from the water column. During their life-time oysters are exposed to a variety of pathogens that can cause severe mortality in a range of oyster species. Environmental stressors encountered in their habitat can increase the susceptibility of oysters to these pathogens and in general have been shown to impact on oyster immunity, making immune parameters expressed in these marine animals an important research topic. RESULTS: Paired-end Illumina high throughput sequencing of six S. glomerata tissues exposed to different environmental stressors resulted in a total of 484,121,702 paired-end reads. When reads and assembled transcripts were compared to the C. gigas genome, an overall low level of similarity at the nucleotide level, but a relatively high similarity at the protein level was observed. Examination of the tissue expression pattern showed that some transcripts coding for cathepsins, heat shock proteins and antioxidant proteins were exclusively expressed in the haemolymph of S. glomerata, suggesting a role in innate immunity. Furthermore, analysis of the S. glomerata ORFs showed a wide range of genes potentially involved in innate immunity, from pattern recognition receptors, components of the Toll-like signalling and apoptosis pathways to a complex antioxidant defence mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large scale RNA-Seq study carried out in S. glomerata, showing the complex network of innate immune components that exist in this species. The results confirmed that many of the innate immune system components observed in mammals are also conserved in oysters; however, some, such as the TLR adaptors MAL, TRIF and TRAM are either missing or have been modified significantly. The components identified in this study could help explain the oysters' natural resilience against pathogenic microorganisms encountered in their natural environment.},

  abstract = {Ostreid oysters (the 'true oysters') represent a large and commercially important family of bivalve molluscs. Several species, such as the Pacific oyster (Magallana gigas), the American oyster (Crassostrea virginica), the European oyster (Ostrea edulis) and the Sydney rock oyster (Saccostrea glomerata), are currently farmed at a large scale. However a number of other species may also be suitable for commercial-scale aquaculture. One such species is the 'black-lip oyster', a large Saccostrea species of uncertain taxonomic affinity found in northern Australia. Here, phylogenetic analysis of the COI gene places this oyster within a clade identified in a previous study of Japanese Saccostrea species, 'Saccostrea lineage J'. To facilitate comparisons between this oyster and the better-studied S. glomerata, de novo transcriptomes were generated from larval stages and adult tissues of both species. Patterns of orthology indicated an expansion of repetitive elements within Saccostrea genomes when compared to M. gigas and C. virginica, which may be reflected in increased evolutionary rates and/or genome sizes. The generation of high-quality transcriptomes for these two commercially relevant oysters provides a valuable resource for gene identification and comparison of molecular processes in these and other mollusc species.},

  abstract = {Oysters are keystone species in estuarine ecosystems and are of substantial economic value to fisheries and aquaculture worldwide. Contending with disease and environmental stress are considerable challenges to oyster culture. Here we report a draft genome of the Sydney Rock Oyster, Saccostrea glomerata, an iconic and commercially important species of edible oyster in Australia known for its enhanced resilience to harsh environmental conditions. This is the second reference genome to be reported from the family Ostreidae enabling a genus-level study of lophotrochozoan genome evolution. Our analysis of the 784-megabase S. glomerata genome shows extensive expansions of gene families associated with immunological non-self-recognition. Transcriptomic analysis revealed highly tissue-specific patterns of expression among these genes, suggesting a complex assortment of immune receptors provide this oyster with a unique capacity to recognize invading microbes. Several gene families involved in stress response are notably expanded in Saccostrea compared with other oysters, and likely key to this species' adaptations for improved survival higher in the intertidal zone. The Sydney Rock Oyster genome provides a valuable resource for future research in molluscan biology, evolution and environmental resilience. Its close relatedness to Crassostrea will further comparative studies, advancing the means for improved oyster agriculture and conservation.},

DNA sequencing has revealed the surprising extent of microbial diversity and how microbial processes run global ecosystems.

To address this gap, we used gene expression data from 17 protist species to create protist.guru: an online database equipped with tools for identifying co-expressed genes, gene families, and co-expression clusters enriched for specific biological functions. Here, we show how our database can be used to reveal genes involved in essential pathways, such as the synthesis of secondary carotenoids in Haematococcus lacustris. We expect protist.guru to serve as a valuable resource for protistologists, as well as a catalyst for discoveries and new insights into the biological processes of microbial eukaryotes.

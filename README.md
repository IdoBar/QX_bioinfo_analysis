# Background

*Marteilia sydneyi* is a protozoan parasite and the causative agent of
Queensland Unknown (QX) disease in *Saccostrea glomerata* (Sydney rock
oyster). Disease outbreaks often lead to high mortality rates and
considerable economic losses in the aquaculture industry. In order to
develop effective disease management and breed strategies, it is
imperative to understand the host/parasite interaction at a molecular
level. This study aims to investigate *S. glomerata*â€™s response to *M.
sydneyi* infection through differential gene expression analysis to
uncover immune mechanisms and potential markers for resistance.

This repository contains the bioinformatics pipeline used to perform the
following research aims:

## Aims

-   Genomic and transcriptomic characterisation of *Marteilia sydneyi*
-   Identify genes that play a role in the defence response of Sydney
    Rock Oysters (*Saccostrea glomerata*) during infection of *Marteilia
    sydneyi* (QX disease)

### Objectives

1.  Assemble the *Marteilia sydneyi* transcriptome
2.  Identify differential gene expression in infected and non-infected
    Sydney Rock Oysters (*Saccostrea glomerata*)
3.  Assemble the *Marteilia sydneyi* genome

Detailed information on the experimental and analysis approaches and
methods, including detailed bioinformatics pipelines and code can be
